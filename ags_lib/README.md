![AMD AGS Library](http://gpuopen-librariesandsdks.github.io/media/amd_logo_black.png)

The AMD GPU Services (AGS) library provides software developers with the ability to query AMD GPU software and hardware state information that is not normally available through standard operating systems or graphics APIs.  If you are serious about getting the most from your AMD GPU, then AGS can help you harness that power.

AGS includes support for querying graphics driver version info, GPU hardware info, performance metrics, shader extensions and additional extensions supported in the AMD drivers for DirectX 11 and DirectX 12.  AGS also provides Crossfire&trade; (AMD's multi-GPU rendering technology) support and Eyefinity (AMD's multi-display rendering technology) configuration info.

This version of the AGS library is just the documentation, header file, import libraries, and DLLs. For the full AGS SDK, which includes samples, visit the AGS SDK repository:
